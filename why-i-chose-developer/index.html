Nothing technical here, i know, watch this space as i will be writing technical specific content in future blog posts.</p> <p>I want to go back to when i was a kid. I didn’t have the luxury of what my other school mates had - a games console, a computer etc. I never had one when i was young. My parents never bought me one despite me wanting one. They wanted me to concentrate on my education. And because of not having it, it made me wanting it more as the years gone past, therefore my passion for technology grew. It was when i was 14 years, the point i needed to pick subjects in school, at this moment i was very clear what i wanted to do. I picked ‘Computing’ as a subject because i wanted to do computing related stuff as a career.</p> <p>Not long after, i quickly realised that i wanted to become a Software Programmer. This might sound stupid but i knew this after i watched the 1995 film “Hackers” on TV. I was totally immersed with the aspect of ‘hacking’. Of course, i know this is illegal but from then onwards i knew my logical career goal was to do Software Engineering and work in the this industry. I then fell in love with programming, enjoying writing code, and do anything that is software related. So i studied Computer Science in university.</p> <p>Soon after graduating, unsurprisingly i moved into the Software Engineering industry. I worked in many different roles and position doing all sorts of things. From development to testing to support to business analysis to working in operations. After spending time in these various areas of Software Engineering i realised what i really enjoyed doing and that is writing code. And so i decided to focus on becoming a “Software Developer”. It is fun. It allows you to be creative because as a developer you are essentially bulding/creating things and i really enjoyed that aspect of it. Having worked in testing and alongside many great testers i know in testing it is mostly about “breaking” things. Unfortunately, i don’t have that mentally. Same goes for when i did operations, i just never enjoyed the maintainence aspect of the work. That is the reason why i chose this path and why i feel development is for me.</p> <aside class="share"> <span>Share this: </span> <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Why i chose to become a Software Developer&amp;url=http://colinbut.github.io/why-i-chose-developer/&amp;hashtags=web,dev,blog,soudev&amp;via=nandomoreirame" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'twitter-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;"> <i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://colinbut.github.io/why-i-chose-developer/" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'facebook-share','width=580,height=296');return false;"> <i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> </aside> <hr> <aside id="comments" class="disqus"> <h2 class="txt-center">Comments</h2> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'colinbut-tech-blog'; var disqus_identifier = '/why-i-chose-developer'; var disqus_title = 'Why i chose to become a Software Developer'; var disqus_url = 'http://colinbut.github.io'; /*var disqus_developer = 1;*/ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a> </noscript> </aside> </div> </article> <footer class="footer t-center"> <div class="container"> <div class="social-icons"> <ul class="text-left"> <li><a href="http://facebook.com/colin.but" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/colin_but" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> </div> <small>&copy; 2021 All rights reserved.
