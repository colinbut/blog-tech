        <title>Why i chose to become a Software Developer</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;hello-everyone-my-name-is-colin-but&quot;&gt;Hello everyone, My name is Colin But…&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.. and this is my first technical blog article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my first article i am going to tell you a short story about why i decided upon this career path in the first place. Nothing technical here, i know, watch this space as i will be writing technical specific content in future blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go back to when i was a kid. I didn’t have the luxury of what my other school mates had - a games console, a computer etc. I never had one when i was young. My parents never bought me one despite me wanting one. They wanted me to concentrate on my education. And because of not having it, it made me wanting it more as the years gone past, therefore my passion for technology grew. It was when i was 14 years, the point i needed to pick subjects in school, at this moment i was very clear what i wanted to do. I picked ‘Computing’ as a subject because i wanted to do computing related stuff as a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after, i quickly realised that i wanted to become a Software Programmer. This might sound stupid but i knew this after i watched the 1995 film “Hackers” on TV. I was totally immersed with the aspect of ‘hacking’. Of course, i know this is illegal but from then onwards i knew my logical career goal was to do Software Engineering and work in the this industry. I then fell in love with programming, enjoying writing code, and do anything that is software related. So i studied Computer Science in university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after graduating, unsurprisingly i moved into the Software Engineering industry. I worked in many different roles and position doing all sorts of things. From development to testing to support to business analysis to working in operations. After spending time in these various areas of Software Engineering i realised what i really enjoyed doing and that is writing code. And so i decided to focus on becoming a “Software Developer”. It is fun. It allows you to be creative because as a developer you are essentially bulding/creating things and i really enjoyed that aspect of it. Having worked in testing and alongside many great testers i know in testing it is mostly about “breaking” things. Unfortunately, i don’t have that mentally. Same goes for when i did operations, i just never enjoyed the maintainence aspect of the work. That is the reason why i chose this path and why i feel development is for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex! Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox. Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack. Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Sex-charged fop blew my junk TV quiz. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Quick, Baz, get my woven flax jodhpurs! “Now fax quiz Jack! “ my brave ghost pled. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed. Flummoxed by job, kvetching W. zaps Iraq. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very bad quack might jinx zippy fowls. Few quips galvanized the mock jury box. Quick brown dogs jump over the lazy fox. The jay, pig, fox, zebra, and my wolves quack! Blowzy red vixens fight for a quick jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joaquin Phoenix was gazed by MTV for luck. A wizard’s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog. Watch “Jeopardy! “, Alex Trebek’s fun TV quiz game. Woven silk pyjamas exchanged for blue quartz. Brawny gods just flocked up to quiz and vex him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusting quiver and bow, Zompyc[1] killed the fox. My faxed joke won a pager in the cable TV quiz show. Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes. My girl wove six dozen plaid jackets before she quit. Six big devils from Japan quickly forgot how to waltz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big July earthquakes confound zany experimental vow. Foxy parsons quiz and cajole the lovably dim wiki-girl. Have a pick: twenty six letters - no forcing a jumbled quiz! Crazy Fredericka bought many very exquisite opal jewels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag. A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats. All questions asked by five watch experts amazed the judge. Jack quietly moved up front and seized the big ball of wax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex! Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz. Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O my friend – but it is too much for my strength – I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.&lt;/p&gt;
